# Project Structure Updates

The Bar Break-Even Calculator has been restructured for better organization:

```
BarBreakdownColculator/
├── index.html           # Main HTML file
├── css/
│   └── styles.css      # Separated CSS styles
├── js/
│   └── calculator.js   # JavaScript logic
└── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## Changes Made

1. Separated concerns into different files:
   - HTML structure in `index.html`
   - Styles moved to `css/styles.css`
   - JavaScript logic moved to `js/calculator.js`

2. Added features:
   - Other Monthly Expenses field
   - Reset button
   - Better visual feedback
   - Improved mobile experience
   - Status indicators for results

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Enter your costs and pricing information
3. Click "Calculate Break-Even" to see results

## Development

- Edit `styles.css` for visual changes
- Edit `calculator.js` for logic changes
- Edit `index.html` for structure changes

The separated files make it easier to:
- Maintain and update code
- Cache resources effectively
- Collaborate with other developers
- Debug issues
- Add new features
